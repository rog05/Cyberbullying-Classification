# Cyberbullying-Classification
Developed a deep learning model to predict whether a tweet contains cyberbullying content. The model leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning architectures to accurately classify tweets.

Key Responsibilities:
Data Preprocessing: Labeled dataset of tweets and performed extensive preprocessing, including tokenization, padding, and one-hot encoding to prepare the text data for model training.

Text Representation: Used embedding layers to transform the textual data into dense vector representations, capturing semantic meaning and context.

Model Architecture: Designed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to effectively capture the sequential nature and contextual dependencies of the tweet text.

Label Encoding: Employed label encoding to convert categorical labels into numerical form for classification.

Training and Optimization: Trained the model using TensorFlow and Keras, optimizing hyperparameters to enhance performance.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, ensuring robust and reliable detection of cyberbullying.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas , Sklearn

Tools: Kaggle Notebook

Outcome: Successfully developed a high-accuracy model for detecting cyberbullying in tweets, contributing to efforts in promoting safer online communities and mitigating harmful interactions on social media platforms
